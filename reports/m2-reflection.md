## Reflection Report

## Implemented Features
1. Filters Panel: The implemented dashboard includes filters for Year, Beats Per Minute, Song Duration, and Genre, similar to the sketch.
2. Scatterplot (Danceability vs. Popularity): The scatterplot is implemented and correctly represents the relationship between danceability and popularity.
3. Top Artists List: A list of top artists for the selected year is displayed.
4. Tooltips on Scatterplot: Tooltips for song details appear when hovering over points in the scatterplot.

## Missing Features
1. Loudness Filter: The sketch included an input box for loudness, which is missing in the implementation.
2. Genres Pie Chart: The sketch proposed a pie chart to show genre distribution, but this is absent in the current dashboard.
3. Energy Bar Chart: The sketch included a bar chart for energy categorization, which has not been implemented.

## Justifications for Deviations
1. The missing features (Loudness filter, Pie Chart, Energy Chart) are due to time constraints. It may be implemented in the upcoming milestone.
2. The design of the implemented dashboard is cleaner but lacks some of the additional insights proposed in the sketch.
3. The number of artists displayed is limited, possibly due to space constraints.

## Known Bugs or Incomplete Features
The filters do not include all the parameters proposed in the sketch (e.g., loudness).
Some visualizations (genre pie chart, energy chart) are completely missing.



## Reflection on the Dashboard
## Strengths
- The dashboard effectively provides a simple and clean interface for exploring music trends.
- The scatterplot visualizing danceability vs. popularity is well-implemented.
- The filters allow for interactive exploration of the dataset.

## Limitations
- The dashboard lacks some of the originally proposed insights, such as genre distribution and energy classification.
- The filters panel could be expanded to include additional parameters like loudness.


## Future Improvements
- Implement missing features like the genre pie chart and energy bar chart.
- Expand the filters panel to include loudness.
- Improve the aesthetics to better align with the original sketch.

Overall, while the dashboard effectively provides basic insights, adding the missing elements would make it a more complete and informative tool.
